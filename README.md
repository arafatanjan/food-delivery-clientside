# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This website is built on using react deployed on firebase, database deployed on mongodb atlas and server deployed on heroku to show food items ready to deliver to customer

The customer has to log in first using google credential to book the item in home page.Then he/she is required to fill up the address button and proceed submit button in booking page.

In my order section he/she will find only his/her orders with the status pending and option delete. He/she can find the orders even after log out and log in. 

Admin can update all the customers' orders by pressing update button or cancel by pressing delete button in https://food-delivery-login-15fa8.web.app/orders/update/:id

Admin can add new services with description, price and image in https://food-delivery-login-15fa8.web.app/addservice.
